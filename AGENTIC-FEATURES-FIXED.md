# âœ… Agentic Features - FIXED AND WORKING!

## What Was Fixed

### ðŸŽ¯ Critical Issues Resolved:

1. **âœ… Email Photo Attachments**
   - Emails now include the report photo as an attachment
   - Photo is clearly indicated in email body with ðŸ“· emoji
   - Professional HTML formatting for better readability

2. **âœ… AI-Generated Professional Emails**
   - Subject: `ðŸš¨ [AI-Generated Subject]`
   - Body: AI-crafted professional message to authorities
   - Includes: Category, Severity, Location, Timestamp
   - Photo attachment with "Photo evidence attached" notice
   - Falls back to template if AI fails

3. **âœ… AI-Generated Tweets with Twitter Handles**
   - Automatically tags `@BBMPCOMM` (Bangalore civic authority)
   - Includes relevant emoji based on category
   - Mentions location name (e.g., "MG Road, Indiranagar")
   - Under 270 characters (Twitter limit)
   - Professional but urgent tone

## Example Outputs

### Email Example:
```
Subject: ðŸš¨ Urgent: Pothole Repair Needed on MG Road

Body:
<h2>Infrastructure Issue Report - Action Required</h2>

[AI-Generated professional message requesting immediate attention]

---
Report Details:
â€¢ Category: Pothole
â€¢ Severity: High
â€¢ Location: 12.971623, 77.641242
â€¢ Reported: 02-10-2025, 01:30 PM IST

ðŸ“· Photo evidence attached

---
Local POC notification via Mailpit
```

### Tweet Example:
```
ðŸš§ @BBMPCOMM Large pothole on MG Road, Indiranagar causing high 
traffic issues. Category: Pothole. Severity: High. Urgent repair 
required to prevent accidents. #BangaloreTraffic #Infrastructure
```

## Technical Implementation

### Email Route (`/api/reports/[id]/notify`)
- Reads photo from storage
- Attaches photo to email
- Calls MCP Gateway for AI email generation
- Sends HTML email with photo attachment via nodemailer
- Fallback to template if AI unavailable

### Tweet Route (`/api/reports/[id]/tweet`)
- Gets location name via reverse geocoding
- Calls MCP Gateway for AI tweet generation
- Ensures @BBMPCOMM is included
- Respects Twitter character limits
- Fallback to template with proper tagging

### MCP Gateway Updates
- New endpoint: `POST /tools/generate.tweet`
- Uses Cerebras LLaMA for tweet generation
- Prompt engineering for:
  - Twitter handle inclusion
  - Character limit adherence
  - Professional but urgent tone
  - Location and category mention

## Testing

### Test Email Generation:
```bash
# Submit a report first, then check Mailpit at http://localhost:8025
# You should see:
# 1. Subject with ðŸš¨ emoji
# 2. Professional AI-generated body
# 3. Photo attachment
# 4. Report details in organized format
```

### Test Tweet Generation:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8008/tools/generate.tweet \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description":"Large pothole causing traffic issues",
    "category":"pothole",
    "severity":"high",
    "locationName":"MG Road, Indiranagar"
  }'

# Expected output:
# {"tweet":"ðŸš§ @BBMPCOMM Large pothole on MG Road, Indiranagar..."}
```

## Why This Is Critical for Demo

### Shows True Agentic Behavior:
1. **Autonomous Communication**: AI writes emails/tweets without human intervention
2. **Context-Aware**: Uses report details, location, category, severity
3. **Authority Tagging**: Automatically mentions @BBMPCOMM for accountability
4. **Evidence Inclusion**: Photo attached to emails for verification
5. **Professional Tone**: AI generates formal communication suitable for authorities

### Demo Flow Impact:
**Before**: "Citizen reports â†’ System stores data"
**After**: "Citizen reports â†’ AI classifies â†’ AI writes professional email with photo â†’ AI crafts tagged tweet â†’ Authorities notified instantly"

This is a **complete autonomous workflow** - true agentic AI!

## Environment Variables Needed

Ensure these are set in `.env`:
```bash
# Email
ENABLE_EMAIL=true
SMTP_HOST=localhost
SMTP_PORT=1025
FROM_EMAIL=infra-agent@localhost
NOTIFY_TO=bbmp@localhost

# MCP Gateway
MCP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8008

# Auto-tweet after email
AUTO_TWEET=true
SIMULATE_TWITTER=true

# Cerebras API (in MCP container)
CEREBRAS_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Demo Script Update

### NEW Demo Flow:
1. **Report Submission**:
   - "Citizen takes photo with GPS location"
   - "Submits: 'Large pothole on MG Road'"

2. **AI Classification** (10 seconds):
   - "AI analyzes: Category=Pothole, Severity=High"

3. **AI Email Generation** (15 seconds):
   - "AI writes professional email to BBMP"
   - "Photo automatically attached"
   - "Shows Mailpit with full email"

4. **AI Tweet Generation** (5 seconds):
   - "AI crafts tweet tagging @BBMPCOMM"
   - "Shows tweet text with handle"

5. **Dashboard View**:
   - "Report shows 'Emailed âœ“' and 'Tweeted âœ“'"
   - "Full transparency"

### Key Talking Points:
- "Notice the AI **wrote the entire email** - professional, contextual, with photo"
- "The tweet **automatically tags @BBMPCOMM** - the real authority account"
- "Photo is **attached as evidence** - no manual work needed"
- "This is **true agentic AI** - end-to-end autonomous workflow"

## Files Changed:
- âœ… `src/app/api/reports/[id]/notify/route.ts` - Photo attachments + AI email
- âœ… `src/app/api/reports/[id]/tweet/route.ts` - AI tweet with handles
- âœ… `mcp-gateway/server.js` - New tweet generation endpoint

## Status: READY FOR DEMO âœ…

All agentic features are now working:
- âœ… Photo attachments in emails
- âœ… AI-generated professional emails
- âœ… AI-generated tweets with Twitter handles
- âœ… Location names in communications
- âœ… Proper authority tagging

**This is the complete autonomous agent experience!** ðŸš€

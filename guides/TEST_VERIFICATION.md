## 📊 Health Check Results

### Next.js API Health
```json
{
  "status": "degraded",
  "services": {
    "web": true,        ✅
    "postgres": true,   ✅
    "mailpit": true,    ✅
    "mcp": false        ⚠️ (checking port 8008, but MCP is on 8009)
  },
  "time": "2025-10-03T18:10:48.860Z"
}
```

**Note:** MCP shows as false because health endpoint checks port 8008, but MCP Gateway is on port 8009. This is cosmetic - MCP Gateway is actually working perfectly!

### MCP Gateway Health
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "mcp-gateway",
  "cerebras": "connected"
}
```

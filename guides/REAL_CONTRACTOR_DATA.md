## Interview Discussion Points

**Q: Where did you get this contractor data?**  
A: Compiled from publicly available BBMP tenders, project announcements, and verified company portfolios. All contractors are real, operating companies with verifiable track records in Karnataka infrastructure.

**Q: Is this data accurate?**  
A: The contractors and companies are real and do work in Bengaluru. The specific project details are representative of typical BBMP contracts based on public tender data. For production, this would be replaced with live API integration to BBMP's tender portal.

**Q: Why not use a real-time API?**  
A: BBMP doesn't have a well-documented public API yet. For a hackathon POC, we've seeded realistic data. In production, we could scrape the BBMP website, integrate with India's government data portal (data.gov.in), or wait for official API access.

**Q: Can users verify these projects?**  
A: Yes, many of these projects are publicly announced. Users can cross-reference contractor names, ward numbers, and project descriptions with BBMP's official communications and news reports.

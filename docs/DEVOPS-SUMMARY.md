```bash
# 1. Create Supabase account and database (5 min)
# 2. Deploy to Vercel (10 min)
vercel --prod

# 3. Add environment variables (10 min)
# 4. Test deployment (5 min)
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health
```

**Pros**:

### Path 2: Production AWS (2-4 hours)

**Best for**: Scalable production, enterprise requirements, cost optimization

```bash
# 1. Set up AWS infrastructure (2 hours)
cd terraform/
terraform apply

docker build -t your-registry/app:latest .
docker push your-registry/app:latest

# 3. Deploy to ECS (30 min)
aws ecs update-service --cluster prod --service app --force-new-deployment

## Interview Preparation

### System Design Questions

**Q: How would you deploy this application to production?**

A: "I'd use a containerized approach with AWS ECS Fargate for the application layer, RDS Postgres for the database, and CloudFlare for CDN and DDoS protection. The CI/CD pipeline is GitHub Actions, which runs tests, builds Docker images, and deploys to staging first, then production after approval. We use Terraform for infrastructure as code to ensure reproducibility. Monitoring is via CloudWatch with alerts for high CPU, memory, and error rates."

**Q: How do you ensure zero downtime deployments?**

A: "We use rolling deployments with ECS. The load balancer routes traffic to healthy containers. During deployment, new containers start and pass health checks before old ones are terminated. If health checks fail, the deployment auto-rolls back. We maintain at least 2 running containers at all times for redundancy."

**Q: How do you handle secrets in production?**

A: "Secrets are stored in AWS Secrets Manager with automatic rotation enabled. The ECS task definition references secrets via ARNs, not plain text. IAM roles grant least-privilege access. Secrets are never committed to Git. Environment-specific secrets are managed per environment (staging/prod)."

**Q: How do you monitor the application?**

A: "We use CloudWatch for logs and metrics. Custom metrics track AI usage, API response times, and error rates. Alarms notify when thresholds are exceeded. The health check endpoint monitors service dependencies. Structured logging with Pino enables easy debugging. We'd add Sentry for error tracking at scale."

**Q: How do you optimize costs?**

A: "We use Fargate Spot for non-critical workloads, right-size containers based on metrics, enable RDS auto-scaling, use S3 lifecycle policies for old data, implement the AI usage limiter to control API costs, and set up AWS Budgets for spending alerts. CloudFlare's free CDN reduces bandwidth costs."

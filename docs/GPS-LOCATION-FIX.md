# GPS Location Fix Documentation

## Problem Solved
The application was using fixed/cached coordinates instead of detecting the user's actual GPS location when capturing photos or uploading images. This meant all reports were showing the same location rather than the actual incident location.

## What Was Changed

### 1. **Real-Time GPS Detection**
- Now **ALWAYS** gets fresh GPS location when:
  - User clicks "Get GPS location" button
  - User captures a photo with camera
  - User uploads a photo from files
  - User submits a report without location

### 2. **High Accuracy with Fallback**
The app now follows a two-tier GPS strategy:

**Primary (High Accuracy):**
```javascript
{
  enableHighAccuracy: true,
  timeout: 15000,
  maximumAge: 0  // Forces fresh location, no cache
}
```

**Fallback (Standard Accuracy):**
```javascript
{
  enableHighAccuracy: false,
  timeout: 10000,
  maximumAge: 30000  // Allows 30-second old cache only as fallback
}
```

### 3. **Accuracy Display**
- Shows GPS accuracy in meters (e.g., "±10m accuracy")
- Warns users if accuracy is poor (>50m)
- Displays coordinates with 6 decimal places for precision

### 4. **Key Features Added**

#### Location State Management
```typescript
const [accuracy, setAccuracy] = React.useState<number | null>(null);
const [locationLoading, setLocationLoading] = React.useState(false);
```

#### Enhanced GPS Function
```typescript
async function getLocationWithFallback(): Promise<{ 
  lat: number; 
  lng: number; 
  accuracy: number 
}>
```

#### Visual Feedback
- 🛰️ "Getting high-accuracy GPS location..." (during acquisition)
- 📍 "Falling back to standard GPS..." (if high accuracy fails)
- ✅ "GPS locked (accuracy: 15m)" (success)
- ❌ "GPS error: [message]" (failure)

### 5. **GPS Enforcement**
- Reports **cannot be submitted** without GPS coordinates
- If location is missing at submission, the app will attempt to get it
- If GPS fails completely, submission is blocked with clear error message

## How It Works Now

### When Taking a Photo:
1. User clicks "Take photo (camera)"
2. Camera opens
3. User clicks "Capture"
4. App immediately requests fresh GPS location (high accuracy)
5. If successful: embeds GPS in photo EXIF data
6. If failed: shows error and doesn't save photo

### When Uploading a Photo:
1. User clicks "Upload from files"
2. Selects a photo
3. App immediately requests fresh GPS location
4. Embeds location in photo metadata
5. Shows location with accuracy level

### Manual GPS Request:
1. User clicks "Get GPS location" button
2. App requests high-accuracy GPS
3. If denied/fails, falls back to standard GPS
4. Shows coordinates and accuracy level
5. Warns if accuracy is poor

## Testing the Fix

### Manual Testing:
1. Open the app at http://localhost:3001/report
2. Click "Get GPS location" button
   - Should show real-time coordinates
   - Should display accuracy in meters
3. Take a photo with camera
   - Should get fresh location each time
   - Location should be different if you move
4. Upload a photo
   - Should get current location, not cached

### Automated Tests:
Run the GPS tests:
```bash
pnpm test tests/unit/gps.realtime.test.tsx
pnpm test tests/unit/location.coordinates.test.ts
pnpm test tests/integration/coordinates.order.test.ts
```

## Accuracy Levels

| Accuracy | Quality | Use Case |
|----------|---------|----------|
| 0-10m | Excellent | Precise location reporting |
| 10-30m | Good | Standard reporting |
| 30-50m | Fair | Acceptable for most cases |
| >50m | Poor | Warning shown, retry recommended |

## Browser Permissions

For GPS to work, users must:
1. Allow location access when prompted
2. Have location services enabled on device
3. Use HTTPS or localhost (required by browsers)

## Troubleshooting

### "Location services disabled"
- Enable GPS/Location on device
- Check browser permissions

### "High accuracy denied"
- App will automatically fallback to standard GPS
- May result in lower accuracy (50-100m)

### "Unable to get location"
- Check internet connection
- Try moving to area with better signal
- Ensure browser has location permission

## Technical Details

### Coordinate Format
- **Latitude**: 12.971623 (6 decimal places)
- **Longitude**: 77.594687 (6 decimal places)
- **Accuracy**: ±15m (meters)

### EXIF GPS Embedding
The app embeds GPS data directly into JPEG files using:
- GPS Latitude/Longitude in DMS format
- GPS timestamp
- GPS date stamp

### Bengaluru Boundaries
Valid coordinates for Bengaluru:
- Latitude: 12.8° to 13.2° N
- Longitude: 77.4° to 77.8° E

## Why This Matters

1. **Accurate Reporting**: Authorities need exact location of issues
2. **Better Response**: Precise GPS helps faster dispatch
3. **Data Integrity**: Each report has unique, verifiable location
4. **User Trust**: Real-time GPS shows transparency
5. **Legal Compliance**: Accurate location for audit trails

## Next Steps

To further improve GPS accuracy:
1. Consider implementing GPS averaging (multiple readings)
2. Add map picker as backup option
3. Store GPS trail for moving reports
4. Implement geofencing for auto-location zones
5. Add offline GPS caching for poor connectivity

## Summary

The app now:
- ✅ Gets **real-time GPS** for every photo/report
- ✅ Shows **accuracy levels** to users  
- ✅ Has **automatic fallback** for reliability
- ✅ **Blocks submission** without valid GPS
- ✅ Embeds GPS in **photo EXIF data**
- ✅ Displays coordinates with **6 decimal precision**

The location is never fixed or cached - it's always the user's current position when they capture or upload a photo.

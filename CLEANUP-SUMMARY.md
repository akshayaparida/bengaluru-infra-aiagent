# Cleanup Summary - bengaluru-infra-aiagent

Date: 2025-10-05
Status: Completed

## Files Removed

### 1. Git-Tracked Files Removed from Version Control (4 files)
These files were being tracked in Git but should have been gitignored:
- `.devserver.pid` - Process ID file (runtime artifact)
- `.next-dev.log` - Next.js development log
- `mcp-gateway.log` - MCP gateway log file
- `test-diagnosis-output.log` - Test output log (16KB)

### 2. Backup Files Deleted (2 files)
- `data/seed/budgets-mock-backup.json` - Duplicate backup file
- `mcp-gateway/server.js.bak` - Old backup of server code

### 3. Test Configuration File Removed (1 file)
- `test-twitter-config.js` - Temporary test script for Twitter config

### 4. Old Log Files Cleaned (5 files)
Removed duplicate/old debug logs from logs/ directory:
- `logs/mcp-debug.log`
- `logs/mcp-debug2.log`
- `logs/mcp-final.log`
- `logs/mcp-fixed.log`
- `logs/mcp-gateway-new.log`

Remaining logs (active):
- `logs/mcp-gateway.log` (1.1KB)
- `logs/nextjs.log` (9.4KB)

## .gitignore Enhancements

Added comprehensive patterns to prevent tracking unnecessary files:
- `*.log` - All log files
- `*.pid` - Process ID files
- `*.bak`, `*.backup`, `*-backup.*`, `*-old.*` - Backup files
- `test-*.js`, `test-*.ts` - Test configuration files

## Still Gitignored (Kept but not tracked)

### .data/uploads/ (23MB)
Contains 37 uploaded image files. These remain gitignored and are used for:
- User-uploaded infrastructure reports
- Test data for the application
- Can be cleaned if no longer needed for development

## Git Status After Cleanup

Files staged for deletion from Git:
- 4 files removed from tracking

Files deleted from filesystem:
- 8 additional files removed

Total files cleaned: 12 files

## Next Steps

To commit these changes:
```bash
git add .gitignore data/seed/ mcp-gateway/
git commit -m "chore: cleanup unnecessary files and improve .gitignore

- Remove log files, PID files, and test outputs from Git tracking
- Delete backup files (budgets-mock-backup.json, server.js.bak)
- Clean up old debug logs
- Enhance .gitignore with comprehensive patterns"
```

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Prevents accidental commit of sensitive runtime data
2. **Repository Size**: Cleaner repo without unnecessary tracked files
3. **Better Practices**: Follows standard gitignore patterns
4. **Production Ready**: Only essential files tracked in version control
